# ngx-extended-pdf-viewer

When this project is finished (or what passes as "finished" in the IT world), it'll be an embeddable
PDF viewer component. It's different from other approaches like ng2-pdf-viewer in that it
provides the full suite of UI widgets. In other words, it looks exactly like the PDF viewer of the browser.

## State of the art

Currently, this is only a preliminary version of the library. It works, but it requires some ugly
workarounds and it's not really embeddable: The CSS file used by the library affects the entire
application.

Please come back in a couple of days, when the problems are - hopefully - solved!

## License and Kudos

The library is based on:

https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js, which has been published under an Apache V2 license
https://github.com/legalthings/pdf.js-viewer, which has also been published unde an Apache V2 license.

Hence the licence of the ngx-extended-pdf-viewer is the Apache V2 license, too.
