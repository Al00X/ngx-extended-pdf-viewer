**Check this first**
The project is a wrapper around Mozilla's PDF viewer, so maybe your bug is caused by the base library. Please check this first by answering these three questions:
- Does the bug also happen on https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.htm? (If so, please open the issue at Mozilla's bugtracker).
- Does the bug also happen on https://pdfviewer.net/simple?
- Can you write a reproducer based on this template project? https://github.com/stephanrauh/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer-issues/tree/master/template


**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Version info**
- Version of ngx-extended-pdf-viewer

**Desktop (please complete the following information):**
 - Browser [basically Internet Explorer, Edge, or any other browser]
 
**Smartphone (please complete the following information):**
 - Device: [e.g. iPhone6]

**To Reproduce**
Can you provide a reproducer? That's a small and simple but complete project demonstrating the bug. It's always a good idea to start from a fresh, new project. There's a template project at https://github.com/stephanrauh/ngx-extended-pdf-viewer-issues/tree/master/template. A side effect is that writing a reproducer often helps you to find bugs of your code. This spares me the embarrassement of pointing our you bugs. More important, it saves me a lot of time. ngx-extended-pdf-viewer has become so popular that answering issues costs a lot of my spare time, so I appreciate your help.

If you really can't provide me a reproducer, please tell me how to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

**Demo PDF file**
Many errors happen with specific PDF files only. So please add a PDF file (after checking the copyright of the PDF file first!)

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.

**Thank you!**
I know from experience how much work filling a form like this is. It's always tedious and annoying. But it helps me to focus on the important points and to speed up development. So thank you very much for your understanding and your patience!
